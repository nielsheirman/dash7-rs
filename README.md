An attempt to write the dash7 stack in Rust

Why not <https://github.com/Stratus51/rust_dash7_alp> ? Good question! @Stratus51 did very good work there. But I disliked that the bit-level operations where so intertwined with the data structs itself. SO I have opted to use <https://docs.rs/deku> for that.

Howeverl, I have to thank @Stratus51 for many of the struct defs themselves and even documentation!
